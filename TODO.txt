+ handle setting (low details, etc.)
+ check why memory and CPU usage is too high. maybe there are objects which not free
+ There are too many `static` objects... is that good?

- make sure all options works well
- use trie<T> instead of map<string,T> (end of string contains value T) (should be faster and less memory)
- move Framework, GameEngine, RezParser to DLLs (not .lib) (???)

* after throw exception make sure we free allocated memory

* use pegs/elevators/etc. as ground for enemies/treasures/etc. too

* catch and throw enemies (like a powder-keg)
* activate object only when CC close to them / they're in screen
* fix last elevators at level 13 (before boss warp)
* add "ADVANCE.ANI" for enemies (before they attack)
* play all objects WAV file
* use dmusic for midi ?
* fix the bosses and enemies (it doesn't feel like the game)
* find perfect speeds (for CC, enemies, projectiles, etc.)
* split all classes to h and cpp files (not 2 classes in 1 file)
