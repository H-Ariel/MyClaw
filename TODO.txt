+ check why memory usage is too high. maybe there are objects which not free

+ handle setting (low details, front plane, etc. add menu)

- make sure all options works well
- use trie<T> instead of map<string,T> (end of string contains value T) (should be faster and less memory)
- move Framework, GameEngine, RezParser to DLLs (not .lib)

* the usage of Warp::DestinationWarp is bad. change it
* fix AmbientSound objects
* play all objects WAV file
* find perfect speeds (for CC, enemies, projectiles, etc.)
* split all classes to h and cpp files (not 2 classes in 1 file)
* use pegs/elevators/etc. as ground for enemies/treasures/etc. too
* catch and throw enemies (like a powder-keg)
* add "ADVANCE.ANI" for enemies (before they attack)
* fix the bosses and enemies (it doesn't feel like the game)
* read about direct-sound and maybe use it (dsound.h)
* find a way to run faster (threads?)
* after throw exception make sure we free allocated memory
